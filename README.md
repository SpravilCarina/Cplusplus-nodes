Project Overview:
This C++ project demonstrates the use of nodes and trees in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The project focuses on implementing various tree data structures, including binary trees, and showcases key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Key Features:
Node Implementation:
Node Class: Created a generic Node class that forms the building block for tree structures. This class includes pointers to child nodes and data storage.
Data Storage: Nodes can store data of various types, allowing for flexibility in the types of trees implemented.
Tree Structures:
Binary Tree: Implemented a binary tree with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).
Binary Search Tree (BST): Extended the basic binary tree to create a BST, providing efficient searching, insertion, and deletion based on the ordering of nodes.
OOP Principles:
Encapsulation: Encapsulated node and tree details within classes, providing a clean interface for interacting with tree structures.
Inheritance: Used inheritance to extend base tree classes for more specialized types of trees, demonstrating polymorphism.
Polymorphism: Implemented virtual functions for common tree operations to allow derived classes to override base class methods.
User Interaction:
Command-line interface for interacting with the tree structures, including adding, removing, and searching for nodes.
Visualization of tree structure to aid in understanding and debugging.
How to Run:
Compile the Code:
Use a C++ compiler to compile the source files. Example command: g++ -o tree_project main.cpp Node.cpp Tree.cpp.
Execute the Program:
Run the compiled executable. Example command: ./tree_project.
Interact with the Program:
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform operations on tree structures, such as inserting nodes and traversing the tree.
Dependencies:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
Standard C++ Library
